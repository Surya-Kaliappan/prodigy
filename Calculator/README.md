# Simple Calculator App

This is a modern, cross-platform calculator application built with Flutter. It was developed as the first task during my Android Developer Internship at @prodigy.

The app provides a clean, intuitive user interface and performs standard arithmetic operations with a focus on a professional, responsive user experience.

## ✨ Features

* **Cross-Platform:** Developed with **Flutter** and **Dart**, enabling a single codebase for both Android and iOS mobile platforms.
* **Intuitive UI:** Features a clean, dark-themed interface with distinct buttons and clear typography.
* **Dynamic Display:** The calculator's display automatically **scales down font size** and **wraps to a maximum of two lines** to accommodate long expressions, ensuring readability without horizontal scrolling.
* **Realistic Calculation Logic:**
    * Correctly evaluates mathematical expressions following **BODMAS** (Order of Operations) using the `math_expressions` package.
    * **Operator Replacement:** Automatically replaces a previously entered operator if a new one is typed consecutively (e.g., `5 + x` becomes `5 x`).
    * **Single Decimal Point:** Prevents multiple decimal points in a single number.
    * **Clean Results:** Formats results to remove unnecessary trailing zeros for whole numbers (e.g., `5` instead of `5.00000000`).
    * **Error Handling:** Displays "Error" for invalid operations like division by zero.
* **Standard Calculator Functions:** Includes all basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `x`, `÷`, `%`), along with `Clear (C)` and `Delete (⌫)` buttons.
* **Visual Feedback:** Buttons feature subtle elevation and animation on press, enhancing user interaction.
* **Custom App Icon & Name:** Configured for both Android and iOS platforms.
